This directory contains the help converters.  Hopefully somebody has some more information than I do, but I've put a couple of notes on the DocBook converter below

docbook:
	Our docbook converter points to the web URI for the DocBook
	stylesheets.  If you don't have XML catalogs set up, then it
	will spend a bit of time fetching these stylesheets over the
	network.
	In order to set up your XML catalogs, you should do something
	like this:

CATALOG=/etc/xml/catalog

/usr/bin/xmlcatalog --noout --create $CATALOG

/usr/bin/xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteSystem" \
	"http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/1.45" \
	"/usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.45-2" $CATALOG
/usr/bin/xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteURI" \
	"http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/1.45" \
	"/usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.45-2" $CATALOG
/usr/bin/xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteSystem" \
	"http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current" \
	"/usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.45-2" $CATALOG
/usr/bin/xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteURI" \
	"http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current" \
	"/usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.45-2" $CATALOG

	Note that those are the local paths for my current version of
	the XSL stylesheets, on a Red Hat Linux 7.2 + Rawhide system.
	You can install the stylesheets anywhere you like, as long as
	you replace the path above with your correct local path.
	Hopefully, debian will be updating their packages to provide
	XML catalogs very soon.
